# Housing Application

This is a React application designed to display housing information dynamically using modern React features like functional components, hooks, and routing. The app includes a carousel, dropdowns, ratings, and a fully responsive UI.

## Features
- Carousel: Displays images of the housing with navigation controls.
- Dropdowns: Expands and collapses to show additional details (description, equipment).
- Dynamic Ratings: Displays a star-based rating system based on the housing score.
- Routing: Uses React Router to handle dynamic routes for each housing.
- Responsive Design: Styled using modern techniques for a seamless experience on all devices.
